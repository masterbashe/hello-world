# hello-world
This is my first git project
I'm Athini Bashe born in 1991 July 20th from Port St Johns, a small town in the Eastern Cape. Did my lower grades in Port St Johns then went to Umtata technical school for matric where i studied electrical engineering, maths, physics and engineering graphic design. i completed my matric in 2009 and in 2010 decided to take a gap year to figure out what i really want to do in life.

In 2011 i enrolled at Walter Sisulu University for national diploma in Information Technology, it was a three year course which i focused on software development. i learned java and visual basic at the time.
